EMAG (Evolutionary Models and Applications Group) is a discussion group at [TSE](https://www.tse-fr.eu/){:target="\_blank"}/[IAST](https://www.iast.fr/){:target="\_blank"}. We are a group of academics interested in mathematical models of evolution (in the broad sense, including but not limited to models of learning, population dynamics, and networks).
Our objective is to bring together theoreticians to discuss their latest works or ideas, in an informal setting.
We would like to use this as an opportunity to learn of each other's models' technical details and give and receive feedback on projects.

EMAG organizes a biweekly online seminar on Mondays, 17:00-18:30 (Central European Time).
The default format is 60 minutes of presentation with 30 minutes of discussion.

If you are interested in participating, please send us an e-mail so we can add you to the mailing list.

Organizers: [Jorge Peña](https://jorgeapenas.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} and/or [Péter Bayer](https://www.sites.google.com/view/peterbayer){:target="\_blank"}
