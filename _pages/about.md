We are a group of researchers interested in mathematical models of evolution (in the broad sense, including but not limited to models of learning, population dynamics, and networks).
Our objective is to bring together theoreticians to discuss their latest works or ideas in a relatively informal setting.

EMAG organizes a biweekly online seminar on Mondays, 17:00-18:30 (Central European Time).
The default format is 60 minutes of presentation with 30 minutes of discussion.

If you are interested in participating, please send us an e-mail so we can add you to the mailing list.

Organizers: [Péter Bayer](https://www.sites.google.com/view/peterbayer){:target="\_blank"} ([TSE](https://www.tse-fr.eu/){:target="\_blank"}) and [Jorge Peña](https://jorgeapenas.github.io/){:target="\_blank"} ([IAST](https://www.iast.fr/){:target="\_blank"})
